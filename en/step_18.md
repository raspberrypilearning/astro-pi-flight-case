## Challenge: improve your case

We've deliberately not shown a really polished gorgeous case, because we're hoping you'll go the extra mile and blow our socks off. Please show us your cases by tweeting pictures of them to [@astro_pi](https://twitter.com/astro_pi){:target="_blank"} and [@raspberry_pi](https://twitter.com/Raspberry_Pi){:target="_blank"}!

Here are some further ideas for customising your case:

- Use metallic grey spray paint
- Use sandpaper to create the matt finish that the bead-blasted aluminium flight cases have
- Engrave decals into the case
- Use different colours of filament for each part

By far the greatest benefit of owning a replica Astro Pi flight unit is the ability to prototype and test code that could be run on the International Space Station. Head over to the [Astro Pi website](https://astro-pi.org/){:target="_blank"} now to get involved!
